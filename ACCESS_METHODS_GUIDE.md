## üé≠ **Mock vs Real Data - IMPORTANT FOR DEMOS**

### **‚úÖ REAL & FUNCTIONAL:**
- **Access Code System** - Fully functional with live database validation
- **User Registration & Authentication** - Real Supabase auth with email confirmation
- **AI Questionnaire** - Real GPT-4 powered conversation and intelligence
- **Report Generation** - Real dynamic reports from actual questionnaire responses
- **Session Management** - Live session tracking and security

### **üé™ MOCK DATA (Demo Only):**
- **Dashboard Content** - Mock automations, analytics, and metrics
- **Automation Opportunities** - Sample/placeholder automation suggestions  
- **Analytics Charts** - Demonstration charts with fake performance data
- **Discovery Feed** - Mock automation discovery suggestions

### **‚ö†Ô∏è For Joe's Demo Understanding:**
When showing the **traditional dashboard** (`/dashboard`):
- Registration process is 100% real
- Dashboard interface and navigation are real
- **BUT** the content (charts, metrics, automations) is demonstration data
- Think of it as "UI/UX prototype with real authentication"

When showing the **access code experience** (`/`):
- Everything is fully functional and real
- AI generates actual personalized questions
- Reports contain real analysis based on responses
- This is the production-ready premium experience

---

## üîÑ **How They Work Together**

### **Separate Systems by Design:**
1. **Access Codes** - Temporary, exclusive, premium experience
2. **User Accounts** - Permanent, self-service, ongoing platform use

### **No Cross-Contamination:**
- Access code users don't create accounts
- Registered users don't use access codes
- Different entry points and user experiences
- Independent session management systems

### **Shared Infrastructure:**
- Same Next.js application
- Same Supabase database (different tables)
- Same AI services (OpenAI GPT-4)
- Same deployment pipeline

## üìã **For Joe - Quick Reference**

### **To Demo Premium Experience:**
1. Go to: `https://reservoir-mvp.netlify.app`
2. Enter access code: `CLOCK-DEMO-2025`
3. Experience the AI-powered questionnaire
4. See the dynamic report generation

### **To Demo Traditional Platform:**
1. Go to: `https://reservoir-mvp.netlify.app/dashboard` (redirects to registration)
2. Create an account with email/password
3. Confirm email and log in
4. Explore dashboard features and pages

### **Which Method to Use When:**

| Scenario | Method | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| ClockworkCoaching member consultation | Access Codes | Premium, time-limited, exclusive experience |
| General platform demo | User Registration | Full feature set, ongoing access |
| Business owner evaluation | Either | Depends on how they arrived (referral vs. self-discovery) |
| Partner/investor demo | Both | Show complete value proposition |

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Management**

### **Access Code Management:**
- **Admin Panel:** `/admin/access-codes` (requires auth)
- **Database Queries:** See `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` for SQL examples
- **Monitoring:** Check usage and expiration in Supabase dashboard

### **User Account Management:**
- **Supabase Dashboard:** Standard user management tools
- **Auth Policies:** Row Level Security configured
- **Email Templates:** Customizable in Supabase Auth settings

### **Environment Configuration:**
Both systems use the same environment variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

## üöÄ **Deployment Status**

Both access methods are **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** in production:

- ‚úÖ Premium access codes working with AI questionnaire
- ‚úÖ User registration and dashboard functional  
- ‚úÖ Independent session management systems
- ‚úÖ Route protection for both methods
- ‚úÖ Shared infrastructure deployed on Netlify

---

## üìû **Support & Troubleshooting**

### **Access Code Issues:**
- Check code status in Supabase: `SELECT * FROM access_codes WHERE code = 'CLOCK-DEMO-2025'`
- Reset usage: `UPDATE access_codes SET current_uses = 0 WHERE code = 'CLOCK-DEMO-2025'`
- Extend expiration: `UPDATE access_codes SET expires_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days'`

### **User Registration Issues:**
- Check Supabase Auth dashboard for user status
- Verify email confirmation settings
- Check RLS policies for data access

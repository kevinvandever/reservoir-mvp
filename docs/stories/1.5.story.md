## Dev Notes
### Netlify Configuration
[Source: architecture/15-deployment-architecture.md#netlify-configuration]

Create netlify.toml in project root:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED = "1"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "esbuild"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
```

### Environment Variables for Production
Required environment variables to set in Netlify dashboard:
```bash
# Supabase Production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<production_url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<production_anon_key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<production_service_key>

# OpenAI (for future use)
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=production

# Monitoring (optional)
SENTRY_DSN=<sentry_dsn>
VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ID=<analytics_id>
```

### Next.js Netlify Adapter
Install and configure @netlify/plugin-nextjs:
```bash
npm install -D @netlify/plugin-nextjs
```

Update next.config.js:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless',
  images: {
    domains: ['your-supabase-url.supabase.co'],
  },
}
```

### Build Optimization Settings
- Enable build caching for node_modules
- Use Netlify Edge Functions for API routes
- Configure ISR for dynamic pages
- Set up proper cache headers

### Preview Deployment Strategy
- Main branch → Production
- Develop branch → Staging environment
- Feature branches → Preview deployments
- Each PR gets unique preview URL

### Deployment Checklist
Before first deployment:
1. Verify all environment variables are set
2. Test build command locally
3. Ensure .env files are in .gitignore
4. Check that database migrations are applied
5. Verify API routes work with edge functions

### Monitoring
[Source: architecture/17-success-metrics-kpis.md]
- Set up Netlify Analytics for traffic monitoring
- Configure Sentry for error tracking
- Add performance monitoring with Web Vitals

### Testing
- Verify production build succeeds
- Test preview deployments work
- Confirm environment variables are accessible
- Check API routes function correctly
- Validate SSL certificate is active

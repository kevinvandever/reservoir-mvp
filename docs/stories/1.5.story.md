## Dev Notes
### Netlify Configuration
[Source: architecture/15-deployment-architecture.md#netlify-configuration]

Create netlify.toml in project root:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED = "1"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "esbuild"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
```

### Environment Variables for Production
Required environment variables to set in Netlify dashboard:
```bash
# Supabase Production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<production_url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<production_anon_key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<production_service_key>

# OpenAI (for future use)
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=production

# Monitoring (optional)
SENTRY_DSN=<sentry_dsn>
VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ID=<analytics_id>
```

### Next.js Netlify Adapter
Install and configure @netlify/plugin-nextjs:
```bash
npm install -D @netlify/plugin-nextjs
```

Update next.config.js:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless',
  images: {
    domains: ['your-supabase-url.supabase.co'],
  },
}
```

### Build Optimization Settings
- Enable build caching for node_modules
- Use Netlify Edge Functions for API routes
- Configure ISR for dynamic pages
- Set up proper cache headers

### Preview Deployment Strategy
- Main branch → Production
- Develop branch → Staging environment
- Feature branches → Preview deployments
- Each PR gets unique preview URL

### Deployment Checklist
Before first deployment:
1. Verify all environment variables are set
2. Test build command locally
3. Ensure .env files are in .gitignore
4. Check that database migrations are applied
5. Verify API routes work with edge functions

### Monitoring
[Source: architecture/17-success-metrics-kpis.md]
- Set up Netlify Analytics for traffic monitoring
- Configure Sentry for error tracking
- Add performance monitoring with Web Vitals

### Testing
- Verify production build succeeds
- Test preview deployments work
- Confirm environment variables are accessible
- Check API routes function correctly
- Validate SSL certificate is active

## QA Results
_To be filled by QA agent_

## Production Deployment Fixes (January 2025)

### Issues Encountered and Resolutions

#### 1. Missing Radix UI Dependency
**Issue**: Build failed with `Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-collapsible'`
**Root Cause**: The collapsible component was created but dependency wasn't installed
**Fix**: 
```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-collapsible
```

#### 2. API Route Static Generation Error
**Issue**: `/api/user/profile` failed during build with `serverAuthHelpers is not exported`
**Root Cause**: Non-existent import and attempting to statically generate API routes
**Fix**:
- Replaced `serverAuthHelpers` with direct Supabase client calls
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent static generation
- Updated imports to use `createClient` from `@/lib/supabase/server`

#### 3. useSearchParams Suspense Boundary Error
**Issue**: `/dashboard` page failed with `useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary`
**Root Cause**: Next.js 14 requires Suspense boundary when using `useSearchParams` in client components
**Fix**:
- Refactored main component to `DashboardContent`
- Wrapped with Suspense boundary in default export
- Added proper loading fallback

#### 4. Node.js Version Warning
**Issue**: Supabase SDK showing deprecation warnings for Node.js 18
**Root Cause**: Netlify was using Node.js 18 by default
**Fix**: Updated `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
```

#### 5. Access Code System Database
**Issue**: CLOCK-DEMO-2025 not working in production
**Root Cause**: Access code system trying to use Supabase but tables/functions didn't exist
**Fix**: Created complete SQL migration:
- `supabase/setup-access-codes.sql` - Complete setup script
- Tables: `access_codes`, `member_sessions`, `access_logs`
- Function: `validate_and_use_access_code`
- Pre-populated demo codes

### Deployment Checklist for Future Releases

1. **Pre-Deployment**:
   - [ ] Run `npm run build` locally to catch build errors
   - [ ] Check all dependencies are in package.json
   - [ ] Verify environment variables in `.env.example`
   - [ ] Test with production environment variables locally

2. **Netlify Configuration**:
   - [ ] Set all required environment variables
   - [ ] Verify Node.js version (20+)
   - [ ] Check build command: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - [ ] Verify publish directory: `.next`

3. **Database Setup**:
   - [ ] Run SQL migrations in Supabase
   - [ ] Verify RPC functions are created
   - [ ] Test access codes work
   - [ ] Check permissions for anon/authenticated roles

4. **Post-Deployment**:
   - [ ] Test critical user flows
   - [ ] Verify access code validation
   - [ ] Check API routes are accessible
   - [ ] Monitor error logs

### Key Learnings

1. **Always test builds locally** before pushing to production
2. **API routes need explicit dynamic configuration** to prevent static generation
3. **Client-side navigation hooks** require Suspense boundaries in Next.js 14+
4. **Database migrations** should be run before deployment when adding new features
5. **Mock services** are useful for development but need database setup for production

## Dev Notes
### Report Generation Flow
[Source: architecture/7-core-workflows.md#questionnaire-flow]

1. User completes questionnaire
2. AI analyzes all responses
3. Calculate scores and metrics
4. Match to automation library
5. Generate personalized roadmap
6. Save report to database
7. Display to user with CTAs

### Report Data Structure
```typescript
interface BusinessAnalysisReport {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  generatedAt: Date;
  executiveSummary: {
    automationScore: number; // 0-10
    annualSavings: number;
    weeklyTimeSavings: number;
    efficiencyGain: number; // percentage
    topPainPoints: string[];
  };
  opportunities: AutomationOpportunity[];
  implementationRoadmap: {
    phases: Phase[];
    estimatedDuration: string;
    quickWins: string[];
  };
  businessProfile: {
    size: string;
    industry: string;
    currentTools: string[];
    goals: string[];
  };
}

interface AutomationOpportunity {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  timeSaved: number; // hours/week
  revenueImpact: number; // $/month
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  implementationTime: string;
  requiredTools: string[];
}
```

### AI Analysis Prompts
```typescript
const analysisPrompt = `Based on the questionnaire responses, analyze this real 
estate professional's business and identify:
1. Top 5 pain points
2. Automation opportunities ranked by impact
3. Estimated time and cost savings
4. Implementation priority order
5. Quick wins they can implement immediately

Format as structured JSON.`;
```

### Report Sections
[Source: frontend/3-business-analysis-report.md]

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Automation score (0-10)
   - Annual savings potential
   - Weekly time savings
   - Efficiency gain percentage

2. **Top Opportunities**
   - 3-5 highest impact automations
   - Priority ranking
   - Time/revenue impact
   - Implementation difficulty

3. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - 6-week phased approach
   - Week-by-week plan
   - Quick wins first
   - Progressive complexity

4. **Next Steps**
   - Start Reservoir trial (primary CTA)
   - Download full report
   - Schedule consultation

### PDF Generation
Use @react-pdf/renderer for consistent styling:
```typescript
import { Document, Page, Text, View, StyleSheet, PDFDownloadLink } from '@react-pdf/renderer';

const ReportPDF = ({ report }) => (
  <Document>
    <Page size="A4" style={styles.page}>
      {/* Report content */}
    </Page>
  </Document>
);
```

# Reservoir Future Phases

This directory contains documentation for advanced features and expanded versions of the Reservoir platform that go beyond the current MVP scope.

## What's Here

These documents represent more complex implementations, enterprise features, and expanded functionality that may be developed after the MVP is successfully launched and validated.

## Document Categories

### **Advanced Architecture & Planning**
- `architecture.md` - More complex technical architecture
- `technical-roadmap.md` - Long-term technical roadmap
- `ai-automation-reservoir-prd.md` - Advanced PRD with expanded features
- `full-reservoir-brief.md` - Complete project brief for full version

### **Enhanced Specifications**
- `AI Questionnaire System - Technical Specifications.md` - Advanced AI system specs
- `front-end-spec.md` / `frontend-spec.md` - Enhanced frontend specifications
- `testing-strategy.md` - Comprehensive testing approach

### **Alternative Approaches**
- `spreadsheet-mvp-option.md` - Alternative spreadsheet-based MVP
- `spreadsheet-mvp-tasks.md` - Tasks for spreadsheet approach
- `rapid-mvp-implementation-plan.md` - Alternative rapid implementation

### **Research & Strategy**
- `market-research-comprehensive.md` - Detailed market analysis
- `mvp-reservoir-project-brief.md` - Original project brief

## When to Use These

These documents should be referenced when:

1. **MVP is Successfully Launched** - Ready to expand beyond core features
2. **Market Validation Complete** - Data supports investment in advanced features  
3. **Technical Foundation Solid** - MVP architecture can support enhanced features
4. **Business Metrics Met** - Core KPIs achieved (500 leads, $19.5K MRR)

## Relationship to MVP

The current MVP (in `/docs/`) is designed to:
- Validate core assumptions
- Establish market fit
- Build initial user base
- Generate revenue to fund expansion

These future-phase documents represent the "what's next" after MVP success.

## Notes

- Documents may contain outdated assumptions - review against MVP learnings
- Some technical approaches may need updating based on MVP implementation
- Business model elements should be validated against MVP data
- Consider user feedback from MVP before implementing advanced features

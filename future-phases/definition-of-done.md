# Definition of Done - AI Automation Reservoir

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-08-14  
**Owner:** Product Owner (Sarah) + Technical Lead (Kevin)  
**Purpose:** Project-wide quality standards and completion criteria

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive Definition of Done (DoD) for AI Automation Reservoir, ensuring consistent quality across all deliverables. Our DoD covers code quality, testing, security, performance, documentation, and user experience standards that must be met before any feature or story is considered complete.

**Core DoD Principle:** *Every deliverable must meet all applicable criteria to be considered "Done" - no exceptions for timeline pressure.*

## Executive Summary

The Reservoir is an integrated AI-powered business automation discovery and implementation system for service professionals, initially targeting real estate agents. It combines an intelligent questionnaire system that conducts $50,000-consultant-level business discovery with a subscription-based "Reservoir" that delivers weekly personalized automation recommendations. The platform transforms how service professionals discover, implement, and track automation opportunities, promising to save 10+ hours per week while increasing revenue.

**Core Value Proposition:** From business analysis to automation implementation - a complete system that identifies and helps implement the exact automations needed to double deals in 6 weeks.

## Problem Statement

### Primary Problem
Service professionals (real estate agents, insurance brokers, consultants) waste 15-20 hours per week on repetitive tasks that could be automated, but they don't know:
- What to automate first
- Which tools to use
- How to implement solutions
- What ROI to expect

### Current Solutions Fall Short
- **Generic automation tools:** Not tailored to specific industries
- **Expensive consultants:** $50,000+ engagements out of reach for most
- **DIY research:** Time-consuming with no personalization
- **Course/training programs:** Theory without implementation support

### Market Opportunity
- 1.5 million real estate agents in the US
- Average agent loses $75,000/year in opportunity cost from inefficiency
- 73% report wanting automation but not knowing where to start
- Automation software market growing 40% annually

# Reservoir App - Rapid MVP Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2025-08-16  
**Author:** Kevin  
**Purpose:** Partner alignment on simplified MVP approach  
**Timeline:** 3-5 days to working product

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a **streamlined approach** to launch the Reservoir app MVP in 3-5 days. Instead of building the full microservices architecture, we'll create a simple but professional web application that validates our core value proposition: **AI-curated automation intelligence for service professionals**.

The approach uses modern, proven technologies that allow us to start simple and scale up as we grow, without throwing away code.

---

## üéØ What We're Building

### Core Product
A web application where service professionals (real estate agents, insurance brokers, consultants) can:
1. Sign up and create a business profile
2. View weekly AI-curated automation discoveries personalized to their business
3. Save and track automation implementations
4. Measure actual ROI from implemented automations

### What Makes This an MVP (Not the Full Vision)
- **No content ingestion pipeline** - We manually curate 20-30 high-quality automations to start
- **No vector database** - Simple PostgreSQL search is sufficient for 100s of automations
- **No microservices** - Single Next.js app handles everything
- **No real-time features** - Weekly updates are enough to prove value
- **No complex AI innovation** - Focus on personalization, not generation

## üíª Technology Stack

### Required Accounts/Services

| Service | Purpose | Cost | Setup Time |
|---------|---------|------|------------|
| **Netlify** | Hosting & deployment | $19/month (Pro tier - you already have) | Already set up |
| **Supabase** | Database + Authentication | $25/month (Pro tier - you already have) | Already set up |
| **OpenAI** | AI personalization | ~$10-20/month for MVP | 5 minutes |
| **Resend** | Email delivery | Free tier (100 emails/day) | 5 minutes |
| **GitHub** | Code repository | Free | Already have |
| **Stripe** | Payment processing | 2.9% + 30¬¢ per transaction | 30 minutes |

**Total Additional Cost for MVP:** ~$10-20 (just OpenAI API usage, since you already pay for Netlify/Supabase)

### Development Stack

```
Framework:     Next.js 14 (React-based full-stack framework)
Language:      TypeScript (type-safe JavaScript)
Styling:       Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
Database:      PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
Authentication: Supabase Auth (includes Google/Email login)
AI:            OpenAI GPT-4 API
Email:         Resend API
Deployment:    Netlify
```

### Why This Stack?

1. **Next.js**: Full-stack framework - frontend + API in one codebase
2. **Supabase Pro**: PostgreSQL database + auth + real-time - you already have Pro tier with 8GB database, unlimited API requests
3. **TypeScript**: Catches errors early, better development experience
4. **Tailwind + shadcn/ui**: Professional UI components ready to use
5. **Netlify Pro**: You already have it, includes faster builds, advanced analytics, and better performance

### Advantage of Your Existing Infrastructure

Since you already have **Netlify Pro** ($19/month) and **Supabase Pro** ($25/month), you get:
- **No additional infrastructure costs** for this MVP
- **8GB database** (can store millions of automations)
- **Unlimited API requests** to Supabase
- **100GB bandwidth** on Netlify
- **Faster builds** and deployment
- **Better support** if issues arise

Your **Railway Pro** account could be useful later for:
- Running Python scripts for content ingestion (Phase 2)
- Background jobs for email sending
- Scheduled tasks for weekly report generation
(But not needed for initial MVP)

- Vector database for semantic search (PostgreSQL full-text search is fine)
- Real-time WebSocket features (not needed for weekly updates)
- Complex microservices architecture (Next.js handles everything)
- Mobile app (web app is mobile-responsive)
- Advanced AI innovation generation (focus on curation/personalization)
- Team collaboration features (individual users only)
- API for third-party integrations (not needed yet)

## üìù Next Steps for Partner Discussion

### Questions to Align On

1. **Pricing**: Start at $39/month or $49/month?
2. **Beta Period**: Free for first month or 50% discount?
3. **Content**: Who curates the initial 20-30 automations?
4. **Marketing**: How do we get first 10 beta users?
5. **Support**: Who handles user questions/feedback?

### Division of Responsibilities

**Kevin (Technical):**
- Build the application (3-5 days)
- Deploy and maintain infrastructure
- Handle technical issues
- Implement user feedback

**Partner (Business):**
- Curate initial automation content
- Write automation descriptions and ROI projections
- Handle user support and feedback
- Marketing and user acquisition
- Quality check AI outputs

### Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

**Green Light If:**
- Partner comfortable with 3-5 day timeline
- We can identify 10+ beta users to invite
- Partner can commit 5-10 hours for content curation
- We agree on pricing and beta strategy

**Red Light If:**
- Partner wants even simpler approach
- Can't identify beta users
- Not ready to charge money yet
- Want to perfect everything before launch

## üí° Final Thoughts

This approach gets us from idea to revenue in less than a week. We'll learn more from 10 real users in week 1 than from 3 months of planning. The technology choices allow us to start simple but scale to thousands of users without rewrites.

The key insight: **We're not building the final product, we're building a learning machine that generates revenue while we figure out what the final product should be.**

Ready to start Monday?

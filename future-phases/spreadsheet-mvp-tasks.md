# Spreadsheet MVP - Lightweight Task Breakdown

## ðŸš€ BOTTOM LINE

**This is a 3-day coding project, not a 3-week development sprint.**

If it takes longer than a week to launch, you're overthinking it. The entire "epic" should fit on one page, and the code should fit in one file.

Remember: Reid Hoffman said "If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late."

A spreadsheet that makes money beats a perfect platform that doesn't exist!
